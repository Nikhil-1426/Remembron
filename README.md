## Remembron

## üí° Introduction:

**Problem Statement**:  Individuals with Alzheimer's contend with daily tasks, memory lapses, and maintaining connections. Modern solutions lack personalized, automated features and raise privacy concerns. This initiative introduces an audio-visual app designed to address these issues, providing reminders, geopositioning and secure information storage.

**Solution**: Remembron is a comprehensive audio-visual app designed for individuals with Alzheimer‚Äôs, offering personalized reminders, geofencing, and guidance. The app features text-to-speech reminders, facial recognition, geofencing capabilities, and speech-to-text functionality to capture information from conversations, ensuring users receive the support they need in their daily lives.

## Key Features:
1. **Facial Recognition:**
   - Employs a machine learning convolutional neural network (CNN) model to identify and recognize familiar faces, aiding users in recognizing family and friends       even when Alzheimer's impairs their cognitive abilities.
2. **Geo-fencing:**
   - Sets up virtual boundaries around a specified home location. Alerts the user via text and audio notifications if they wander beyond these boundaries,             providing directions back home to ensure safety.
3. **Speech-to-Text (STT):**
   - Tracks daily conversations to identify key tasks and reminders. Converts spoken words into text to automatically create reminders for important tasks like         taking medications or attending appointments.
4. **Text-to-Speech (TTS):**
   - Delivers reminders and notifications through audio, ensuring that users receive timely verbal prompts for their daily activities and alerts if they cross
     geo-fenced boundaries.

## Additional Features:
- **Reminders:**
   - Allows users to create, edit, and delete daily reminders, which are updated in real-time and can be presented via text or speech.
- **User-Friendly Interface:**
   - Designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind, particularly catering to the elderly demographic who are most affected by Alzheimer's.
- **Secure Authentication:**
   - Uses Firebase Authentication for secure sign-up and sign-in processes.

## Tech Stack
1. **Flutter / Dart:**
   - Used for building a seamless, cross-platform mobile application with a user-friendly interface designed for individuals with Alzheimer's.
2. **Firebase:**
   - Stores user data, reminders, geofencing information, and facial recognition data, providing real-time synchronization and easy access.
3. **FireAuth:**
   - Provides secure user authentication and management, ensuring that user data remains protected.
4. **Google Maps API:**
   - Utilized for geo-fencing and providing directions, ensuring users stay within safe boundaries and can easily find their way back home.
5. **TensorFlow:**
   - Develops and trains the convolutional neural network (CNN) model for facial recognition, ensuring accurate and efficient identification.
6. **Gemini API:**
   - Processes and tracks reminders through the user's conversations.
7. **Figma:**
   - Used for designing and prototyping the app's user interface and user experience, ensuring a visually appealing and intuitive design.
